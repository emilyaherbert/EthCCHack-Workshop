# Asset Contract

This contract will be the asset that is accepted in the fundraising contract.

The skeleton of the contract is written for you already, but you will be completing the body of it.

### Steps

1. Fill in the `mint_and_send_to_address` function in [the `src/main.sw` file](src/main.sw)

2. Ensure that you are inside this subdirectory in your terminal, then run:

    ```bash
    $ forc build
    Compiled library "core".
    Compiled library "std".
    Compiled contract "asset".
    Bytecode size is 84 bytes.
    ```

3. Done! ðŸ˜Š
